I am a former world champion who has faced Claressa Shields and Savannah Marshall and been on some massive stages.

Yet there was a strong feeling of the unknown when I made the ring walk for my bare knuckle debut in a bullfighting arena in Marbella which looked like a mini colosseum.

I felt electric, like a gladiator. This was a completely different sport to boxing.

You cannot spar without gloves when training for bare knuckle, so I had no real idea how it would actually feel to punch – and be punched – without protection on your fist.

Immediately before the start, the referee told us to "tow the line" – which is different from boxing as there are no opposite corners in the circular BKFC ring.

You are told to "knuckle up" as you stand beside your opponent. There is no feeling out process before meeting in the centre of the ring.

During the first two rounds I was learning on the job, but halfway through the third I found my range and flow. I put my combinations together and I then understood what this sport was all about.
